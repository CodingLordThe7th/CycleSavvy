3) Features — Spoken demo (UI-first)

Open the app and the map is front-and-center: it centers on your location and shows routes as clear polylines.

The control card is the main tool: a big green Start button to begin live GPS tracking and a red Stop button to end and save the ride.

While you ride the path is drawn in real time and the live readouts show distance, time, and speed — everything you need at a glance.

Use the History dropdown to pull up past rides instantly and replay or export them.

Pick a route from the built-in list, or upload a GPX from your Profile and load it — the route is drawn on the map so you can follow it.

On the Profile page you can edit weight (for calories), manage uploaded GPX files under Saved Routes, and set goals (daily/weekly/monthly) with progress bars and streaks.

The Community page contains global and custom leaderboards so you can compare rides, create groups, and invite friends.

Bike & Repair gives quick maintenance tips and safety reminders so riders stay prepared.

Settings control theme, font size, and offline behavior. Rides save locally when you're offline and sync to the server when you reconnect.

That’s the UI-first walkthrough — Start, ride, Stop, and everything else is there to help you plan, track, share, and stay safe.

5) Where data lives
- Supabase tables used:
  - profiles: stores `profile` JSON (with goals, weight, etc.) and `cumulative_score`.
  - user_routes: metadata about uploaded GPX files (path, public URL) stored in Supabase storage.
  - rides: each ride record stores coordinates, meta (start/end, duration, calories), and awarded points.
- Files (GPX) are stored in Supabase storage under the `gpx` bucket and referenced by `user_routes`.

6) Extensibility notes / next steps
- Automatically credit goals when a ride completes (ride-tracker should call profileManager.creditGoal()).
- Add timers per-goal (start/pause/resume) and persist timer state to Supabase.
- Add recurrence resets that run server-side or by a scheduled worker to reset daily/weekly/monthly goals.
- Add route discovery: index the GPX routes by length/area and allow filtering and search.

7) Troubleshooting & developer notes
- If sign-in isn't updating the UI, ensure `js/supabase-config.js` is loaded before `js/auth.js` and `js/profile.js`.
- If goals aren't appearing, check that `profiles.profile.goals` contains an array using Supabase console.
- Logs are sent to the browser console; global helpers `notify()` and `showToast()` provide UI feedback.

Conclusion
- That's the overview and demo script for CycleSavvy. If you'd like, I can produce a shorter 60-second elevator pitch or expand any section into a slide-ready paragraph.
