Features — Spoken demo (UI-first)

Open the app and the map is front-and-center: it centers on your location and shows routes as clear polylines.

The control card is the main tool: a big green Start button to begin live GPS tracking and a red Stop button to end and save the ride.

While you ride the path is drawn in real time and the live readouts show distance, time, and speed — everything you need at a glance.

Use the History dropdown to pull up past rides instantly and replay them. (Exporting history is not part of this build.)

The map also shows pins for preloaded routes — tap a pin to see a popup with the route name, its length, and a "Load Route" button. Loading a pin draws that GPX on the map and adds a small route label so you can follow or trace it.

Pick a route from the built-in list, or sign in and upload a GPX from your Profile; uploaded files appear under "Saved Routes" and also show up in the route selector when you're signed in.

Sign in to access saved/uploaded routes and community features. When signed in you can manage your uploaded GPX files from the Profile page and they will be available from the Fetch/Route selector.

On the Profile page you can edit weight (used for calories), manage uploaded GPX files under Saved Routes, and set goals (daily/weekly/monthly) with progress bars and streaks.

The Community page contains global and custom leaderboards so you can compare rides, create groups, and invite friends (sign-in required for posting/creating groups).

Bike & Repair gives quick maintenance tips and safety reminders so riders stay prepared.

Settings control theme, font size, and offline behavior. Rides save locally when you're offline and will sync when the app reconnects to the server if you have an account.

That’s the UI-first walkthrough — Start, ride, Stop, and everything else is there to help you plan, track, and follow routes using pins or your saved GPX files.
